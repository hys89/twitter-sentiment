# # Using NLTK Vader to analyse the sentiment of tweets 
# 
# VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. 
# VADER uses a combination of A sentiment lexicon is a list of lexical features (e.g., words) which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative.
# 
# VADER has been found to be quite successful when dealing with social media texts, NY Times editorials, movie reviews, and product reviews. 
# This is because VADER not only tells about the Positivity and Negativity score but also tells us about how positive or negative a sentiment is.
# 
# VADER has a lot of advantages over traditional methods of Sentiment Analysis, including:
# - It works exceedingly well on social media type text, yet readily generalizes to multiple domains
# - It doesnâ€™t require any training data but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon (Amazon Mechanical Turk labelling)
# - It is fast enough to be used online with streaming data, and
# - It does not severely suffer from a speed-performance tradeoff.
# 
# To install Vader, use 
# > pip install vaderSentiment 
# You may also need to install 'requests' library too.
